# random-label

This script is really useful for all the times you just need a simple label
and can't think of something really funny. All the generated labels are in 
swiss german (Baseldytsch) and most likely will contain german umlauts.

## Usage
Get it:
```
git clone https://github.com/el-seirh/random-label.git
```
Execute the shellscript:
```
<path-to-randomlabel>/randomlabel.sh
```
